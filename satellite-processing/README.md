* post-processing of satellite data

- Scripts provided work on AATSR data from CCI http://data.ceda.ac.uk/neodc/esacci/aerosol/data/AATSR_SU and MODIS data from http://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/archive/allData/. For the paper year 2010 was used.
- The aggregation scripts in this folder work only with cistools.net version 1.4. Newer versions do not handle masked data properly and include them with missing value into the calculation of mean.
